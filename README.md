### A chat client demo

## About

This demo's purpose is for creating a chat client while harnessing the power of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), while integrating with Socket.io via [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org).

## Getting Started

To start following along from the beginning, do `git checkout step-01`.  At each step, an overview will be detailed about the app in `README.md` - this will include design philosophies, what to add to your app, and how to architect the app to best take advantage of Angular & Sails.
